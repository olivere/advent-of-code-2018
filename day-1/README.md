# Day 1

## Problem 1

This is simply adding up all values in a text file, line by line.

```
$ go build problem1.go
$ cat input.txt | ./problem1
500
```

## Problem 2

This is about finding the first sum that's been seen twice. Notice
that there is no guarantee the problem will ever stop.

```
$ go build problem2.go
$ cat input.txt | ./problem2
709
```
